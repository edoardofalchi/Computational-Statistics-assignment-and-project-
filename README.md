# Computational Statistics :computer: | Edoardo Falchi | Summersemester 2021

This repository contains the group assignment problem set solution (made by me, Carolina Alvarez and Wilko Oltmanns) and my project in the other folder.

_Pset solution_ :   
I provide both the jupyter notebook and the R file for the raw codes.
The problem set instructions are in the pdf file.
